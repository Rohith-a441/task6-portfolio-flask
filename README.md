# 🌟 Personal Portfolio Website – Built with Flask & Modern UI/UX

> 🎯 **Goal:** Create a fully responsive, animated personal portfolio web application using Python Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — with modern design principles, dark mode, and contact form functionality.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This is a **personal portfolio website** that demonstrates my skills, education, work experience, and technical abilities. It includes a fully working contact form, toggleable dark/light themes, background images, and elegant animations — making it not just functional, but **visually impressive** and professional.

Designed to meet the **top 10 performer criteria** for internship submission.

✅ Responsive on all screen sizes (mobile/tablet/desktop)  
✅ Glassmorphism cards and modern UI/UX  
✅ Scroll-based animations using AOS.js  
✅ Full backend integration using **Python Flask**

## 🖥️ Setup & Installation

> Make sure you have Python 3 installed  
> Tested with Python 3.10+ and Flask 2.x

### 🔧 Setup Steps

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/Rohith-a441/task6-flask-portfolio.git
cd task6-flask-portfolio

# (Optional) Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install Flask

# Run the application
python app.py
Then visit 👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.

🧠 Code Walkthrough
🔹 app.py
Uses Flask for routing and form handling

Sends flash messages and toggles dark/light themes using JSON + cookies

Contains /contact POST route for contact form submission

🔹 index.html
Built with Jinja2 templating for dynamic behavior (e.g. flash messages)

All sections styled using CSS variables and classes

Integrated AOS animations and SweetAlert2 pop-up logic

Theme toggle implemented via JavaScript and cookies

🔹 style.css
Implements glassmorphism, shadows, and transition effects

Contains theme variables for light and dark modes

Background image automatically changes on theme switch

Fully responsive using Flexbox and media queries

📌 How This Project Stands Out
✅ Full-stack project using Python Flask
✅ Combines functionality, visuals, and user experience
✅ Dark/light mode toggle with real-time background transitions
✅ Clean project structure with modular code
✅ Impressively styled sections with real-world content
✅ Built entirely from scratch without a CSS framework
✅ Created specifically for internship evaluation and top-tier selection
